This folder contains the following exercise: Write a Python program that asks the user for the purchase price of an item. The program must calculate a down payment equal to 10% of the purchase price and determine the initial balance after the down payment. Then, calculate a fixed monthly payment equal to 5% of the initial balance. Using an annual interest rate of 12%, generate and display a monthly payment schedule that shows, for each month, the balance, interest, principal, total payment, and remaining balance. The program should continue until the balance is fully paid off.
