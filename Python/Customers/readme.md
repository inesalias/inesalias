Develop a Python program that reads customer information from two text files. Each file contains records with a customer number followed by three additional fields, separated by commas. Store all the records in a list named customers. Then, sort the list by the customer number in ascending order and write the sorted data into a new text file called merged_customers.txt. The program must display messages indicating when each input file is read and when the output file is successfully created.
